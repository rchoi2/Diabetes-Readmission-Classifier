# Diabetes-Readmission-Classifier

The hospital in which you work has a goal to reduce hospital readmission rates for diabetic patients. Both the hospital finance and clinical care teams are interested in how the data science team may help these departments reach this goal.

Develop a model which predicts whether a patient will be readmitted in <30 days. A new diabetic readmission reduction program intervention will use this model in order to target patients at high risk for readmission. Models will be evaluated on AUC, False Positive Rates, True Positive Rates.
